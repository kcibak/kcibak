My name is Kira Cibak and I am a computer science student at the University of South Florida. I have experience programming in C/C++ and Java and 
am gaining even more experience with C and C#. I'm looking forward to entering the workforce and applying my newly-refined skills.

Right now, I'm learning Python and JavaScript.
